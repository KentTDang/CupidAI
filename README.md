# Disaster Response 
Develop a system of AI agents to coordinate disaster response and relief efforts efficiently. 
The system should optimize resource allocation, logistics, communication, and real-time decision-making.

# Agent Structure

1. Resource Allocation Agent - What do they need ?
Task: Optimize the distribtuion of resources (food,water, medical supplies)

2. Logistics Agent - How can we get it to them?
Task: Plan and manage the transporation and delivery of resources

4. Situation Analysis Agent - How severe or what is the disaster?
- Task: Analyze the disaster situation using data from various sources (weather, social media).

5. Decision-Making Agent
Task: Make high-level decisions based on input from other agents

# How is it going to work?

The user can enter the current disaster and the agent will conduct research on the severity of the disaster and the necessary actions to take
The user can ask the agents what disasters are occuring and what steps to take
